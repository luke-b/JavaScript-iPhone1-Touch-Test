# iphone1-touch-demo
An iPhone 1 animated touch demo ([click for a live demo here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/luke-b/iphone1-touch-demo/blob/master/index.html)) <br/>
(do a fling gesture on the ball or with a mouse do a drag-accelerate-release on the ball to move it)

When the first iPhone 1 with only the web-SDK came out this <br/>
was a simple demo to test how it can be used for games <br/>
and animations ... <br/>
